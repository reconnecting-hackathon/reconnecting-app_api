## Technical Discussion

> Top fact was built using Node JS / Express / Postgres in the backend and the EJS templating engine to render the front end. Javescript was used for simple DOM manipulation.
> Customized games are first pulled from the open trivia api and then saved in the psql database to be rendered at a later date.
